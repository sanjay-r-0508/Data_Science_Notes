    "- which is probability theory that describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be ralted to the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naive:** It is called naive because it assumes that the occurance of a certain feature is independent of the occurence of the pther features.\n",
